# General
Webgui for the RCLL-Simulator

# How to Use

Build the docker image with the command:

> docker build -t [your prefered image name] .

where [your prefered image name] can be what ever you like.
To run the container then you need to expose the ports 4200 of this container to be able to connect with your browser.
Depending on how you run the simulation you might need to expose the port 8000 of the simulation for the frontend to be able to fetch data.
